## 1st. Code Line:

### As you can see, line 1 is written `bl_info = {` that code means that we are beginning to write the metadata for the Blender addon on the sequence begin to write the metadata. Also the characters `=` and `{`are the beginning of the declaration of the metadata array that opens what is coming next.

## 2nd. Code Line:

### The code `"name": "BOQM",` defines the name of my addon, which means "Blender Object Quick Menu", in its extensive form by the double commas `"BOQM"`. Before that, the double commas `"name"` requests the name from my addon, which also appears in the Blender. The screen will look something like this:

## 3rd. Code Line:

### The code is just defining the description by the key `"description"`, which is "Blender Object Quick Menu".

## 4th. Code Line: 

### This line defines the author of the addon, which is me, by the code in double commas `"author"`.Precisely, my nick c0rtex.

## 5th. Code Line:

### What this whole line does? well... sets the `"version"` key with the value `(0, 0, 1)`, representing the version of the addon, in this case, the version 0.0.1.

## 6th. Code Line:

### Here, is the minimum required version for this addon work in Blender, which is defined by the value associated with the `"blender"` key, which is `(4, 0, 0)`, indicating that at least version 4.0.0 of Blender is required.

## 7th. Code Line:

### Defines the `"location"` of the addon, meaning that we can locate it in the drag menu on the side corner of the 3D Viewport as you can see in the following image example:

### Now with the arrow dragged:

## 8th. Code Line:

### Displays a warning about the alpha development with the message: `"This addon still in it's alpha development."`.

## 9th. Code Line:

### Opens a commas to a link for my project's wiki page, which will be added soon after the final version release.

## 10th. Code Line:

### Places an `"Add Mesh"` category and closes the metadata.

## 11th. Code Line:

### Empty Code Line.

## 12th. Code Line:

### This looks simple, but is the core of the code, this imports everything from the Blender API. The codes, the modules, the commands, and everything that would give a lot of work to finish this code, were resolved by just importing the open source code Programming Interface from Blender, which is defined by the code `import bpy` on the code source. I could explain more about this, but it is so dense that deserves his own specific explanation, so I'm just keeping it as a mention for now.
